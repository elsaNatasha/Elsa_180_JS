            design, dense plantings, and a mixture of ornamental and edible plants.
        </p1>
        <p2>The Cottage Garden originated in <u>England</u> and its history
        can be traced back for centuries,
    although they were re-invented in 1870's England,
when stylized versions were formed as to the more structured and rigorously 
maintainedd <u>English estate gardens.</u></p2>
<p3>The earliest cottage gardens were more pratical than their moden descendants,
    with an emphasis on vegetavles and herbs, along with some fruit tress.
